# Next.js Email Client

This is an email client template built with Next.js and Postgres. It's built to show off some of the features of the App Router, which enable you to build products that:

- Navigate between routes in a column layout while maintaining scroll position (layouts support)
- Submit forms without JavaScript enabled (progressive enhancement)
- Navigate between routes extremely fast (prefetching and caching)
- Retain your UI position on reload (URL state)
